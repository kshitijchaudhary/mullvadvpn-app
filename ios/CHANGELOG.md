# Changelog
All changes to the software that can be noticed from the users' perspective should have an entry in
this file. Except very minor things that will not affect functionality, such as log message changes
and minor GUI adjustments.

### Format

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

Entries should have the imperative form, just like commit messages. Start each entry with words like
add, fix, increase, force etc.. Not added, fixed, increased, forced etc.

Line wrap the file at 100 chars.                                              That is over here -> |

* **Changed**: for changes in existing functionality.
